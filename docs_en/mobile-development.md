## Native vs. Cross-Platform Development Selection Guide

### üéØ Reasons to Choose Native Development (Kotlin/Swift):

When your application needs to squeeze every bit of performance out of the device, native development is the only choice. In these scenarios, native code can directly communicate with the underlying hardware, achieving unparalleled execution efficiency:

**‚ùå Functions that Cross-Platform Frameworks Absolutely Cannot Do:**

- üõ°Ô∏è **Network Control** - VPN tunnel creation, system-level traffic routing, network usage statistics, application traffic monitoring.
- üìÅ **Deep File Access** - System directory browsing, accessing other application data, application usage time statistics (Android), system log analysis.

**‚ö†Ô∏è Functions that Cross-Platform Can Do, but with Significantly Worse Results:**

- üïπÔ∏è **Mobile Games** - Native can achieve a stable 60fps+ with direct GPU manipulation (Android: Vulkan API, iOS: Metal), while cross-platform is limited to about 30-45fps with restricted GPU functionality. Famous examples: Genshin Impact, PUBG Mobile, Honor of Kings, Honkai Impact 3rd.
- üì∏ **Camera Apps** - Native supports simultaneous multi-lens operation, RAW format, and professional manual controls (iOS: ProRAW, Android: Camera2 API). Cross-platform is limited to basic photography and simple filters. Famous examples: VSCO, Lightroom Mobile.
- üé¨ **Video Editing** - Native allows for hardware-accelerated encoding/decoding and 4K real-time preview (iOS: VideoToolbox + Metal, Android: MediaCodec). Cross-platform is limited to software encoding with restricted resolution. Famous examples: CapCut, Final Cut.
- ü•Ω **AR Apps** - Native provides precise tracking and environmental understanding (iOS: ARKit has a clear advantage, Android: ARCore). Cross-platform AR functionality is basic and less stable. Famous example: Pok√©mon GO.
- üéµ **Audio Processing** - Native can achieve professional-grade low-latency audio processing (iOS: Core Audio, Android: AAudio). Cross-platform has higher audio latency and limited functionality. Famous example: GarageBand.

**üü° Functions that Cross-Platform Can Do, but with a Slightly Worse Experience:**

- üîí **Biometrics** - Native allows for full control over Face ID/Touch ID processes and custom UI (iOS: LocalAuthentication, Android: BiometricPrompt). Cross-platform can only call the system default interface with low customization. Famous examples: Banking apps, password managers.
- üì° **Near-Field Communication** - Native supports full NFC read/write and complex BLE device communication protocols (iOS: Core NFC, Android: NFC API). Cross-platform NFC functionality is limited and BLE stability is poorer. Famous examples: Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, smart home control apps.
- üöó **In-Car Integration** - Native allows for deep integration with CarPlay/Android Auto features and dedicated in-car UI (iOS: CarPlay framework, Android: Android Auto). Cross-platform is limited to basic audio playback. Famous examples: Spotify, Google Maps.
- ‚åö **Wearable Devices** - Native provides full health data synchronization and watch face interaction (iOS: WatchKit, Android: Wear OS). Cross-platform is limited to basic notifications and simple data exchange. Famous examples: Nike Run Club, Strava.
- ‚ôø **Accessibility** - Native allows for precise control over VoiceOver and TalkBack experiences (iOS: Accessibility framework, Android: AccessibilityService). Cross-platform accessibility support is incomplete and varies greatly between platforms. Famous examples: Be My Eyes, Seeing AI.

For applications with extremely high security and stability requirements, such as financial payments, healthcare, and IoT control, only native development can fully utilize the platform's built-in security chips, encryption APIs, and permission management architecture to protect users' sensitive data at the hardware level.

### üöÄ Reasons to Choose Cross-Platform Development (React Native/Flutter):

When development speed and resource efficiency are your primary considerations, cross-platform development frameworks show a huge advantage. A single codebase covering both iOS and Android platforms not only increases your product launch speed by 50-70% but also significantly reduces maintenance costs‚Äîyou no longer need to fix bugs in two separate codebases or worry about the consistency of feature updates. For small teams or startups with limited resources, cross-platform development allows you to accomplish with one developer what used to require two platform engineers. If your application mainly deals with business logic, content display, or data processing, rather than pursuing ultimate performance, cross-platform frameworks can already provide a sufficiently good user experience. Especially in the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) stage, quickly validating market demand is more important than perfect technical implementation. Cross-platform development allows you to test the waters at the lowest cost, and then consider whether to switch to native development for optimization after confirming the product direction.

### üì± Famous App Technology Selection Examples:

**Native Development Apps:**

- **Instagram**: Swift for iOS, Kotlin/Java for Android
- **Uber**: Native development for optimal map and GPS performance
- **WeChat**: Native development to support complex social features
- **TikTok**: Native development to ensure video processing performance
- **Spotify**: Audio processing requires native performance

**Cross-Platform Development Apps:**

- **Facebook/Meta**: React Native (their own framework)
- **Airbnb**: Previously used React Native (later switched to native)
- **Alibaba/Taobao**: Uses Flutter for some features
- **Google Ads**: Developed with Flutter
- **Discord**: Developed with React Native

**Note**: Many large applications adopt a hybrid strategy, using native development for core functions and cross-platform frameworks for some modules to balance development efficiency and performance needs.

## Mobile Development Language Comparison

| Language / Platform | Vibe Coding |
|---|---|
| **Kotlin**<br>Android (Official Recommendation) | ‚úÖ**Advantages:** AI can fully leverage its modern syntax and null safety features, producing high-quality and less error-prone code. Integration with Android SDK and Java libraries is completely seamless.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:** Integration with non-JVM ecosystems (like native C libraries, Python data science libraries) is more complex compared to languages like Python or JavaScript.<br>üéØ **Use Cases:** AI-assisted Android app development, Kotlin Multiplatform projects, backend microservices. |
| **Swift**<br>iOS, macOS, watchOS | ‚úÖ**Advantages:** Exclusive to the Apple ecosystem, with excellent performance and memory safety. It can unleash the full potential of the platform, including support for Apple Pencil.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:** Poor interoperability with non-Apple ecosystems, limiting its cross-platform capabilities.<br>üéØ **Use Cases:** Developing high-performance native apps that deeply integrate Apple hardware features. |
| **React Native (JavaScript)**<br>iOS, Android | ‚úÖ**Advantages:** Still the lowest barrier to entry for web developers moving into mobile. Allows for reuse of a large number of JavaScript libraries.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:** Performance bottlenecks persist, and the communication bridge with the native system can be a source of instability.<br>üéØ **Use Cases:** Content-display-oriented or cross-platform applications that do not have high demands for native performance. |
| **Flutter (Dart)**<br>iOS, Android, Web, Desktop | ‚úÖ**Advantages:** Its self-drawing engine provides excellent UI consistency and high performance. The AOT/JIT compilation of the Dart language balances development efficiency with runtime speed, and it supports Apple Pencil pressure sensitivity.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:** Integration with native code is relatively complex, and the Dart ecosystem is still smaller compared to JavaScript.<br>üéØ **Use Cases:** Cross-platform applications pursuing highly customized UI and smooth animations. |
