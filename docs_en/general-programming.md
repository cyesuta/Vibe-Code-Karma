# üíé General-Purpose Programming Languages

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Why General-Purpose Programming Languages Are Not Recommended for Individual Developers**

In the era of AI-assisted programming, individual developers should prioritize "specialized tools" over "general-purpose solutions" when selecting technologies. While general-purpose programming languages like Ruby and Java are powerful, they are often replaced by more specialized tools in individual development scenarios:

### The Dilemma of Ruby
Although its syntax is elegant and expressive, there are better specialized tools for anything an individual developer might want to do. Want to build a web application? Node.js and Python Flask are more lightweight and have richer ecosystems. Want to write automation scripts? PowerShell and Python are more specialized system management languages. Want to create a desktop application? Tauri offers a more modern development experience. Ruby's "generality" has become a burden.

### The Heavyweight Problem of Java
For individual developers, Java is too heavyweight, with complex setup, slow startup, and high memory consumption. Want to build a cross-platform desktop application? Electron or Tauri are more lightweight. Want to build a web backend? Node.js or Python Flask are more concise. Java's enterprise-grade stability is over-engineering for personal projects.

### The Logic of Choice in the AI Era
When AI can help you quickly get started with any language, the "learning curve" is no longer a primary consideration; "problem-solving efficiency" is key. Specialized tools can achieve goals faster than general-purpose languages. This is why individual developers should choose the "most suitable tool" rather than the "most general language."

## General-Purpose Programming Language Comparison

| Language / Positioning | Vibe Coding |
|---|---|
| **Ruby**<br>Elegant General-Purpose Language | ‚úÖ**Advantages:** Extremely flexible and expressive syntax. Its pure object-oriented design allows AI to generate elegant and readable code. Excellent for DSL design.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:** Performance limitations and multithreading issues make it less competitive in modern applications. Most use cases have more specialized alternatives.<br>üéØ **Use Cases:** Internal enterprise tool development, complex domain-specific language design. Not recommended as a primary choice for individual developers. |
| **Java**<br>Enterprise-Grade Stable Platform | ‚úÖ**Advantages:** The stability and cross-platform capabilities of the JVM are unparalleled. AI can leverage the vast ecosystem and mature toolchains to generate reliable enterprise-grade code.<br>‚ö†Ô∏è **Disadvantages:** Verbose syntax and heavyweight frameworks make it over-engineered for individual developers. Development efficiency is lower than modern specialized tools.<br>üéØ **Use Cases:** Large-scale enterprise backend systems, fields requiring extremely high stability like finance and telecommunications. Not suitable for the agile development needs of individual developers. |
